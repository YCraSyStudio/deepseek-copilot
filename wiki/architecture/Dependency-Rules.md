# Dependency Rules

## Hard rules

- `src/application` must not import `vscode`, React, or concrete HTTP clients.
- `src/contracts` must not import `vscode`, React, filesystem, or HTTP clients.
- `src/ui` must not import Node extension code.
- `src/infrastructure` must not import React or VS Code UI code.
- API-origin policy belongs to `src/shared/security`; it is not provider-owned.
- `apiKey` must not be stored in settings; it only belongs in `SecretStorage`.
- The extension is DeepSeek-only: do not add Ollama branches or a multiprovider selector.

## Allowed direction

- `platform/vscode` may depend on `application`, `contracts`, `infrastructure`, and `shared`.
- `application` may depend on `contracts` and runtime-neutral `shared` modules.
- `infrastructure` may depend on `application`, `contracts`, and `shared`.
- `ui/chat` should communicate with the backend only through the message contract.
- Concurrent generations must use an async-scoped `ToolWorkspace`; do not switch the process-wide host while a run is active.
- Conversation writes remain serialized per conversation, and mutating tools remain serialized per workspace.

## When to create an interface

Create an interface when domain logic needs to:

- read files.
- write files.
- list directories.
- search content.
- execute commands.
- access the active workspace.

The port belongs in `src/application/ports`; concrete implementations live in `src/infrastructure` or `src/platform/vscode`.

ESLint enforces these directions with scoped `no-restricted-imports` rules.
`src/test/architecture/LayerBoundaries.test.ts` resolves aliases and relative
imports to guard the same boundaries in the unit suite.
