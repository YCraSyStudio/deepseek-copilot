## Rules reflected in this project

- Images are uploaded to the Files API and referenced in chat by `file_id`; Base64 is not part of stored or provider messages.
- Vision accepts JPEG, PNG, GIF, and WebP. The extension verifies signatures before upload.
- Thinking can be disabled without removing tools.
- Tool arguments are JSON strings and are host-validated before execution.
- Thinking tool turns retain `reasoning_content` in their canonical protocol sequence.
- Strict tool mode is beta-only and must not be sent to the stable endpoint.
- Provider capabilities are time-sensitive; verify these links when changing identifiers, schemas, limits, or prices.
