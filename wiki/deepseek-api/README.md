# DeepSeek API

The AI integration lives in `src/infrastructure/deepseek` and is exclusive to DeepSeek.

Responsibilities:

- build requests compatible with DeepSeek.
- run chat completion and streaming.
- keep FIM unavailable until a dedicated beta endpoint and request contract are implemented.
- support tool calls.
- upload, reference, and delete images through the DeepSeek Files API.
- provide V4 Vision directly and as the visual analyzer used by V4 Pro.
- map HTTP/SSE errors into errors handlers can consume.

Do not reintroduce `Ollama`, a multiprovider selector, or placeholders for other providers.
