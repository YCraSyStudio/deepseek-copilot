Registered V4 capabilities use a 1M-token total context and 384K maximum output; the extension reserves 8,192 output tokens by default. Concurrency defaults to 8 and accepts values from 1 to 16.",
        "Type ./ to autocomplete safe workspace paths. Parent traversal with ../ is never accepted. In multi-root workspaces, paths begin with a stable alias such as ./frontend/src/App.tsx.",

        "V4 Vision (Flash) receives DeepSeek file IDs directly. V4 Pro receives analyze_images only when the current prompt has images; that tool asks Vision for a bounded text description that Pro can read.",
        "If experimental Vision becomes unavailable on the official API, text work retries once with stable V4 Flash. A direct image chat continues without the images and states that limitation; V4 Pro image analysis fails explicitly so a text-only model is never mistaken for vision.",
        "Uploads use the DeepSeek Files API with purpose user_data and a 30-day expiry. Base64 is transient clipboard IPC only and is never stored in history or sent inside provider messages.",

Enter restarts the transport and continues the same task under the new guidance; holding Ctrl changes the button to Queue, and Ctrl+Enter appends an independent draft after the active response. Shift+Enter inserts a newline.",

Tool cycles have no configurable round or per-block call limit; an independent reviewer checks progress after 20 completed rounds and every five rounds thereafter without disabling tools.",

        "Output is bounded; when truncated, the beginning and end are retained and the omitted middle is marked.",
        "Detached and background process launchers are rejected. Agent terminals disable .NET build-server and node reuse so completed builds do not leave orphaned workers or locked project files.",
        "In automatic modes, terminal commands and file mutations are classified by a separate DeepSeek instance as routine, elevated, or critical; there is no local danger analyzer.",
        "The reviewer receives the initial user request, a content-free action description, mechanical scope facts, and bounded non-sensitive context from explicitly named workspace files.",

        "History can be disabled and retention can be configured from 0 days (manual deletion only) to 3650 days. The default is 30 days.",
        "Disabling history enters Incognito mode. Active generations and queued prompts require confirmation before they are stopped and cleared. Incognito chats stay only in memory, survive navigation between Chat, History, and Settings, and are discarded when the extension or VS Code reloads. When leaving, the current chat can be explicitly saved as a new conversation or discarded.",
        "The history list is rebuilt directly from validated conversation files. Storage is capped at 100 conversations and 24 MiB.",
        "Deleting one conversation or all visible conversations uses a native VS Code confirmation and offers Undo. Deletion first cancels active work and clears its queue/checkpoint; image cleanup waits until Undo expires so restoration remains complete.",

Complete older generations are summarized atomically; large files are reduced to literal relevant line ranges. Tool arguments, required reasoning, and active tool cycles are never truncated.",
